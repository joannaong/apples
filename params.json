{"name":"Apples","tagline":"","body":"# APPLES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project Overview\r\n\r\n**Overview**\r\n\r\nFor this project, I'm going to detect webcam gesture using HTML5 Video and Canvas. On succesful detection, a CSS3 animation will play.\r\n\r\n**Origin Story - you don't have to read this**\r\n\r\nThis idea originally came from apples. I was thinking of a simple way to detect when an apple is grabbed from SL's dining table, and somehow playing an animation saying \"yay, you're being healthy today!\" I initially thought of a couple ideas like - using weight detection on an iPad (meh), or just simply clicking a button on an iPhone whenever you grab an apple, but as we all know, clicking is a bit clich√©d. Then I remembered Bos' [mailman talk](http://wesbos.com/talks/fitc/#17) and decided emulate that. Basically, he showed a demo of how he captured gesture using his phone, used canvas to compare pixels and WebRTC to talk to his desktop! COOLIO. But... I wanna learn CSS3 too! So I thought I could do a simple CSS3 animation or rotation or something when its successfully detected. Hooray.\r\n\r\n**Inspirations**\r\n\r\n+ HTML5 and Canvas: I found out about this from one of Wes Bos' talk regarding [Hardware Access and Device APIs with JavaScript and HTML5](http://wesbos.com/talks/fitc/#17) and have always wanted to give it a try. \r\n+ CSS3: [http://codepen.io/fixcl/pen/AtdvG](http://codepen.io/fixcl/pen/AtdvG), [http://codepen.io/jkneb/pen/feCvg](http://codepen.io/jkneb/pen/feCvg), [http://secretrobotron.github.io/breaking-the-box/](http://secretrobotron.github.io/breaking-the-box/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\n* Learn as much new CSS3 features as I can (transform, transition, animation, etc.)\r\n* Learn CSS3's limitations and capabilities\r\n* Take advantage of GPU acceleration with CSS3 hacks\r\n* Get to know Canvas and some of the things it can do\r\n* Lean more about HTML5 videos\r\n* Be more familiar with Github\r\n* Share final product and do a post about it\r\n* Relax and have fun. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is Innovative\r\n* CSS is continually growing and it's amazing to see what it can do now\r\n* Using the webcam has been restricted to Flash for the longest time, and its very interesting to know that HTML5 and javaScript can do that now too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n* [Joanna Ong](https://twitter.com/leethelobster)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n* Secret Location, Ryan Andal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* [Capturing Audio & Video in HTML5 - getUserMedia() API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/)\r\n* http://www.8bitrocket.com/2013/01/25/html5-canvas-web-cam-chrome-html5-video-puzzle-of-you-demo/\r\n* http://www.webdesignermag.co.uk/tutorials/capture-webcam-video-with-html5/\r\n* http://www.soundstep.com/blog/2012/03/22/javascript-motion-detection/\r\n* http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/javascript-motion-detection.html\r\n* http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/increase-your-sites-performance-with-hardware-accelerated-css\r\n* http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_canvas.asp\r\n\r\n\r\n## What were you able to accomplish from your original goals?\r\n* 75% -- Learn as much new CSS3 features as I can (transform, transition, animation, etc.)\r\n* 75% -- Learn CSS3's limitations and capabilities\r\n* YAY! -- Take advantage of GPU acceleration with CSS3 hacks\r\n* YAY, in terms of drawing from video -- Get to know Canvas and some of the things it can do\r\n* YUP! -- Lean more about HTML5 videos\r\n* YUP! -- Be more familiar with Github\r\n* TODO! -- Share final product and do a post about it\r\n* YAY! -- Relax and have fun. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What did you learn?\r\n* getUserMedia - accessing webcam using HTML\r\n* HTML to canvas\r\n\r\n\r\n## How could we use this learning on projects moving forward?\r\n* Accessing webcam could be done using HTML and JS!\r\n* Drawing to canvas is pretty sweet - just because its just another HTML element and you can apply cool CSS tricks with it such as opacity, filters, animations, etc.\r\n* CSS animations is easy to understand","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
