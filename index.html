<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>For this project, I'm going to detect webcam gesture using HTML5 Video and Canvas. On succesful detection, a CSS3 animation will play.</p>

<p><strong>Origin Story - you don't have to read this</strong></p>

<p>This idea originally came from apples. I was thinking of a simple way to detect when an apple is grabbed from SL's dining table, and somehow playing an animation saying "yay, you're being healthy today!" I initially thought of a couple ideas like - using weight detection on an iPad (meh), or just simply clicking a button on an iPhone whenever you grab an apple, but as we all know, clicking is a bit clich√©d. Then I remembered Bos' <a href="http://wesbos.com/talks/fitc/#17">mailman talk</a> and decided emulate that. Basically, he showed a demo of how he captured gesture using his phone, used canvas to compare pixels and WebRTC to talk to his desktop! COOLIO. But... I wanna learn CSS3 too! So I thought I could do a simple CSS3 animation or rotation or something when its successfully detected. Hooray.</p>

<p><strong>Inspirations</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>HTML5 and Canvas: I found out about this from one of Wes Bos' talk regarding <a href="http://wesbos.com/talks/fitc/#17">Hardware Access and Device APIs with JavaScript and HTML5</a> and have always wanted to give it a try. </li>
<li>CSS3: <a href="http://codepen.io/fixcl/pen/AtdvG">http://codepen.io/fixcl/pen/AtdvG</a>, <a href="http://codepen.io/jkneb/pen/feCvg">http://codepen.io/jkneb/pen/feCvg</a>, <a href="http://secretrobotron.github.io/breaking-the-box/">http://secretrobotron.github.io/breaking-the-box/</a>
</li>
</ul><h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn as much new CSS3 features as I can (transform, transition, animation, etc.)</li>
<li>Learn CSS3's limitations and capabilities</li>
<li>Take advantage of GPU acceleration with CSS3 hacks</li>
<li>Get to know Canvas and some of the things it can do</li>
<li>Lean more about HTML5 videos</li>
<li>Be more familiar with Github</li>
<li>Share final product and do a post about it</li>
<li>Relax and have fun. :)</li>
</ul><h2>What is Innovative</h2>

<ul>
<li>CSS is continually growing and it's amazing to see what it can do now</li>
<li>Using the webcam has been restricted to Flash for the longest time, and its very interesting to know that HTML5 and javaScript can do that now too. </li>

</ul><h2>What were you able to accomplish from your original goals?</h2>

<ul>
<li>75% -- Learn as much new CSS3 features as I can (transform, transition, animation, etc.)</li>
<li>75% -- Learn CSS3's limitations and capabilities</li>
<li>YAY! -- Take advantage of GPU acceleration with CSS3 hacks</li>
<li>YAY, in terms of drawing from video -- Get to know Canvas and some of the things it can do</li>
<li>YUP! -- Lean more about HTML5 videos</li>
<li>YUP! -- Be more familiar with Github</li>
<li>TODO! -- Share final product and do a post about it</li>
<li>YAY! -- Relax and have fun. :)</li>
</ul><h2>What did you learn?</h2>

<ul>
<li>getUserMedia - accessing webcam using HTML</li>
<li>HTML to canvas</li>
</ul><h2>How could we use this learning on projects moving forward?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Accessing webcam could be done using HTML and JS!</li>
<li>Drawing to canvas is pretty sweet - just because its just another HTML element and you can apply cool CSS tricks with it such as opacity, filters, animations, etc.</li>
<li>CSS animations is easy to understand</li>
